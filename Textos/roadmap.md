# ROADMAP

* First Half of 2020: State of the art and Team Building

   After fixing our objective as a challenger class for the BWSC, we build the dream team and strart studiyng previous designs, their pros and cons, get mentors and buid habits for remote working and designing of a solar car. We get the software and hardawe needed for the work.

* Q3 2020: General design

  After having the dream team ready and with all the knowledge needed, we sart setting the restrictions for our car, based on the car's enviroment and the competition's rules. We come up with three designs good enough to test and determine the best.
  
* Q4 2020: Specific design

  With the general design ready and with the team having all the skills neccesary, it's time to dive into the really technical aspect of the project. This is where we think about erery possible detail of the car, from the suspension and direction systems to the hinge wich opens our roof to capture the sun better when the car is parked. Also, this is where the strategy team overtakes the desition making process, giving objective reasons to design conflicts between different Ã¡reas.

* Q1 2021: Transition to Manufacturing:

  After having the car fully designed, we need to find the way to bring it to reality. This is, contacting the necessary supplyers, partnering with key manufacturing companies.
  
* Q2 2021: Manufacturing and Fundraising:
  
  NFT sale starts. We buy key manufacturing materials and start the manufacturing of the carbon-fiber structure. We also buy the electrical components and start manufacturing custom aluminium mechanical parts such as suspension and direction parts.

* Q3 2021: Main Manufacturing: 

   We finich the carbon-fiber structure of the car and mount the mechanical parts and electrical parts.
   We start testing the vehicle and messure key constants for the strategy.

* Q4 2021: Fishing of car and Racing
   
   We finish the car's last details such as the control systems, cameras and lights.
   NFT sale ends and the EMUs get printed on the car for the world to admire.
   The car competes in the Telemetry race in October.
   
* After Telemetry Race: 

   The team looks for another competition before the BWSC 2023. Before every race, the EMUs on the car get updated to the current images on the virtual representation.
