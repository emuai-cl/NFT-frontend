# ROADMAP OF THE CAR
* First Half of 2020: State of the art and Team Building

After fixing our objective as a challenger class for the BWSC, we build the dream team and start studying previous designs, their pros and cons, get mentors and build habits for remote working and designing of a solar car. We get the software and hardware needed for the work.

* Second Half of 2020: General design

With the dream team ready and with all the knowledge needed, we set the restrictions for our car, based on the car's environment and the competition's rules. We come up with three designs good enough to test and determine the best.

* Q1 2021: Specific design

Dive into the really technical aspect of the project and thinking about every possible detail of the car. Also, this is where the strategy team overtakes the decision-making process, giving objective reasoning in design conflicts.

* Q2 2021: Transition to Manufacturing:

After having the car fully designed, we need to find the way to bring it to reality. This is, contacting the necessary suppliers, partnering with key manufacturing companies, and fixing possible designing problems with them.

* Q3 and Q4 2021: Structural Manufacturing:

We buy key manufacturing materials and start the manufacturing of the carbon-fiber structure. We also buy the electrical components and start manufacturing custom aluminum mechanical parts such as suspension and direction parts.

* First Half 2022: Mounting and Testing:

We finish the carbon-fiber structure of the car and mount the mechanical and electrical parts. We test the vehicle and measure key constants for the strategy. EMUs get printed on the car for the world to admire. We take the car for a ride along the beautiful Chilean landscapes.

* Second Half 2021: Racing

We compete in the Sasol Solar Challenge in South África or in the American Solar Challenge in the United States of América, where millions of people will be watching.

* After the first race:

The team looks for another competition before the BWSC 2023. Options are in Chile, United Arab Emirates, Europe and/or a race organized by us. Before every race, the EMUs on the car get updated to the current images on the virtual representation.
