# ROADMAP OF THE CAR
* First Half of 2020: State of the art and Team Building

After fixing our objective as a challenger class for the BWSC, we build the dream team and start studying previous designs, their pros and cons, get mentors and build habits for remote working and designing of a solar car. We get the software and hardware needed for the work.

* Second Half of 2020: General design

After having the dream team ready and with all the knowledge needed, we start setting the restrictions for our car, based on the car's environment and the competition's rules. We come up with three designs good enough to test and determine the best.

* Q1 2021: Specific design

With the general design ready and with the team having all the skills necessary, it's time to dive into the really technical aspect of the project. This is where we think about every possible detail of the car, from the suspension and direction systems to the hinge which opens our roof to capture the sun better when the car is parked. Also, this is where the strategy team overtakes the decision-making process, giving objective reasoning in design conflicts.

* Q2 2021: Transition to Manufacturing:

After having the car fully designed, we need to find the way to bring it to reality. This is, contacting the necessary suppliers, partnering with key manufacturing companies, and finding possible designing problems with them.

* Q3 and Q4 2021: Manufacturing:

We buy key manufacturing materials and start the manufacturing of the carbon-fiber structure. We also buy the electrical components and start manufacturing custom aluminum mechanical parts such as suspension and direction parts.

* First Half 2022: Main Manufacturing:

We finish the carbon-fiber structure of the car and mount the mechanical parts and electrical parts. We start testing the vehicle and measure key constants for the strategy.

* Second Half 2021: Fishing of car and Racing

We finish the car's last details such as the control systems, cameras, and lights. EMUs get printed on the car for the world to admire. We compete in the Sasol Solar Challenge in South África or in the American Solar Challenge in the United States of América.

* After the first race:

The team looks for another competition before the BWSC 2023. Options are in Chile, United Arab Emirates, Europe and/or a race organized by us. Before every race, the EMUs on the car get updated to the current images on the virtual representation.
