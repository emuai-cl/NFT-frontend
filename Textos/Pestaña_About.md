# History

EMUAI was founded in 2017, born of the initiative of several students from the Faculty of Engineering and Sciences of the Adolfo Ibáñez University (UAI), whose main objective was to build a two-seater solar hybrid vehicle that would be able to compete in the most important race in Latin America, the Carrera Solar de Atacama 2018. In this race, we were crowned champions with our first solar car: The Emu-Alpha.
Currently we are a multidisciplinary team of students from the UAI, which is dedicated to designing and building solar cars and then taking them to competitions around the world. Our mission is to motivate and educate young people by promoting the development of sustainable transport, with the vision of generating a space where students can undertake highly complex projects and applied research, to develop, promote, and perfect their professional skills at an early stage of their university careers. 

# "NOMBRE DEL AUTO" COMPETITIONS:
**Bridgestone World Solar Challenge**
The Bridgestone World Solar Challenge (BWSC) is known as the most challenging solar race in the world. A unique feature of this race is that all of the cars are completely different and designed from scratch, which places particular emphasis on their autonomy and functionality.
The weather conditions are extreme, as the race crosses the Australian desert from Darwin to Adelaide, covering more than 3000 kilometres over 7 days. It will take the cars through strong winds and sometimes rain near the coastal cities. This is why we can say that the BWSC is more than just a race; it is a challenge.
The next iteration of this race will take place in October 2023, with three different participant categories: Cruiser, Adventure, and Challenger. We have decided to participate in the Challenger class, focusing mainly on the performance of the vehicle and trying to get from start to finish in the shortest possible time.
The Bridgestone World Solar Challenge has sought to promote electromobility for over 30 years, encouraging young people to learn about the technology behind sustainable transportation and to develop cutting-edge vehicles powered solely by solar energy. This race acts as a launchpad for innovation in the field of sustainanility.

As the 2021 edition of this race was cancelled, a new competition took it's place in the form of a "Telemetry Race" in wich the teams compete globally by sending their telemetry data to a server, making it public for everyone to analize. This race woulod take place in October 2021, organized by the BWSC.

But this is not all. We are looking to compete in Chile in 2022...
