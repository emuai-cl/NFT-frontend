# FIRST NFT RACE CAR FUNDING


## Revolutionazing Crowdfunding with an Innovative NFT Application
What would happen if the Red Bull stratos, the highest skydive in hystory would have been crowd-funded and the suit and capsule would have been covered by art instead of RedBull logos? How would the narrative have changed and how cool would it have been to own a pice of that suit for the world to see? And how about a Formula One car or a sports team? Now are the days where this is possible, where the funding for the entretainment industry can come from people like you and me instead of big corporations. But noone has ever done this kind of crowdfunding before, not unil today.

In EMUAI, we want to sell pieces of our solar car's surface for people to cover with images they find special. Maybe history will remember us as the pioneers and maybe we will be the first in this new and better way to get funding. And the best part is that you can be a part in this, all of this thanks to Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts and NFTs.






##Dear prospective supporter,

On behalf of the Electromovilidad team of Adolfo Ib치침ez University, I would like to thank you for your interest in our project. Our team aims to push the limits of what is possible not only with sustainable transport, but also with NFTs and funding methods, introducing people to our community through our participation in solar car competitions. For these, we create original concept vehicles powered by solar energy, and put them to the test in races through harsh conditions.
We have already taken our first step in the 2018 Atacama Solar Race in Chile, where we competed with a hybrid solar car and came out on top. Now it's time to take our second big step: we will compete internationally at the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge with a 100% solar car, capable of crossing the Australian continent with nothing but the sun's energy.

We would like to invite you to be part of this challenge and to promote the development of sustainable transport while using the latest NFT technology. Together with your support, we believe that we will become one of the most prestigious solar car teams in Latin America and the world. At the Adolfo Ib치침ez University, we are taught teamwork, communication, and critical thinking, elements that are often underestimated in engineering projects. Thanks to these, we were able to build a team that many can only dream of, where the desire to learn and to push clean technology is the driving force behind our dedication and commitment at work. Thanks to these same qualities, we have developed strategic alliances beyond the university that help us where we lack experience. These include mentoring, consultancy, and joint development from various countries such as Canada, Belgium, and Argentina. We are more than a group of individuals; we are a family, and we hope that trough this new way of crowdfunding, you will also join us on this extraordinary journey.

Best regards,

Oliver Stehr
Team Manager
