# FIRST NFT RACE CAR FUNDING


Dear prospective buyer,
On behalf of the Electromovilidad team of Adolfo Ib치침ez University, I would like to thank you for your interest in our project. Our team aims to push the limits of what is possible not only with sustainable transport, but also with NFTs and introduce people to our community through our participation in solar car competitions. For these, we create original concept vehicles powered by solar energy, and put them to the test in races through harsh conditions.
We have already taken our first step in the 2018 Atacama Solar Race in Chile, where we competed with a hybrid solar car and came out on top. Now it's time to take our second big step: we will compete internationally at the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge with a 100% solar car, capable of crossing the Australian continent with nothing but the sun's energy.
We would like to invite you to be part of this challenge and to promote the development of sustainable transport while using the latest NFT technology. Together with your support, we believe that we will become one of the most prestigious solar car teams in Latin America and the world. At the Adolfo Ib치침ez University, we are taught teamwork, communication, and critical thinking, elements that are often underestimated in engineering projects. Thanks to these, we were able to build a team that many can only dream of, where the desire to learn and to push clean technology is the driving force behind our dedication and commitment at work. Thanks to these same qualities, we have developed strategic alliances beyond the university that help us where we lack experience. These include mentoring, consultancy, and joint development from various countries such as Canada, Belgium, and Argentina. We are more than a group of individuals; we are a family, and we hope that trough this new way of crowdfunding, you will also join us on this extraordinary journey.

Best regards,

Oliver Stehr
Team Manager
