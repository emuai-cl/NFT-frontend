# FAQ

## What space will I get on the Solar Car?

EMUs are sold in ascending order, so it starts with the ID 1 and ends with the ID 5940. The position in the car is distributed form left to right and from top to bottom, like the way you read this text. We will start with the left side of the car from the pilot's point of view.

## Will my NFT run useless after it gets printed on the car?

After we print the NFTs on the car, you can still sell them to someone else. The image can be changed virtually, and the solar car's EMUS will be updated before every race.

## Why can't I see my image on the virtual car? 

After you update your EMU's image, it can take some time for it to update. Please up to wait 24h before filing a complaint.

## If you care about the planet so much, how are you doing NFTs on Ethereum?

More congestion on the network doesnâ€™t necessarily mean more energy consumption. More miners do. Now, you could argue that more congestion increases the gas price and thus the incentive to mine, and so increasing the energy consumption and the emissions.
While this may be true, we admit having a meaningful carbon footprint just by the logistics of a race and the fabrication of a solar car. Our mission is to motivate and educate young people by promoting the development of sustainable transport so that we can accelerate its adoption. The future impact that we make on the planet will greatly surpass of carbon footprint. We know that around 80% of our ex-team members now work in the electromobility or solar energy sector, so this impact is already meassurable. Doing NFTs grately helps our team to expand and ensure many more years of innovation in the renewable ennergies sector.
