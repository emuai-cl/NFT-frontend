## What place will I get on the Solar Car?

EMUs are sold in acending order, so it starts with the ID 1 and ends with the ID 5940. The position in the car is distributed form left to right and from top to bottom, like the way you read. We will start with the left side from the pilot's piont of view.

## Will my NFT run useless after it gets printed on the car?

After we print the NFTs on the car, you can still sell it to someone else. The image can be changed virtually and the solar car's EMUS will be updated before every race.

## Why can't I see my image on the virtual car? 

After you update your EMU's image, it takes time for it to update. Please wait 24h before filing a complaint.

While this may be true, we admit to have a meaningful carbon footprint just by the logistics of a race and the fabrication of a solar car. Our mission is to motivate and educate young people by promoting the development of sustainable transport so that we can accelerate it's adoption. The future impact that we make on the planet will greately surpass of carbon footprint. We know that around 80% of our ex-teammembers now work in the electromobility or solar energy sector.
